Description:
This program will function as a project/assignment/team management tool, specifically for students in the BYU IS Core. In theory, we are looking to auto connect it to LearningSuite so that it will auto-update as things progress in the summer. Eventually, we could look at generalizing the program further for other students both at BYU and at other schools.
